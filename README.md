# User-Interaction-Based-GPT-Circuit-Response-Structure-Report

Repository Overview

This repository documents case-based observations of output behavior, response modulation, avoidance patterns, and structural sensitivity during interactions with a large language model.

The content focuses on:
	•	Output pattern analysis
	•	Changes in response flow
	•	Characteristics of avoidance mechanisms
	•	Comparison between user structural input and system output

⸻

⚙️ Purpose
	•	To document how large language models respond to structural-level inputs
	•	To analyze transitions in response behavior
	•	To examine structural interaction patterns
	•	To preserve records related to response flow and structural adaptation

⸻

🧩 Features
	•	Structure-based analysis rather than emotion-based interpretation
	•	Focused on internal output behavior and transitions
	•	Captures interactions between user input and model response
	•	No interpretation of external influence—only system-level behavior is considered

⸻

🧷 Notes

This repository is intended as a technical record of interaction patterns and system behavior.
All documentation is based on observed input–output interactions, without reference to any external entities or claims.
